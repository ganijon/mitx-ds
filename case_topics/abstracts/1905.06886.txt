Artificial neural networks revolutionized many areas of computer science in recent years since they provide solutions to a number of previously unsolved problems. On the other hand, for many problems, classic algorithms exist, which typically exceed the accuracy and stability of neural networks. To combine these two concepts, we present a new kind of neural networks---algorithmic neural networks (AlgoNets). These networks integrate smooth versions of classic algorithms and data structures into the topology of neural networks. A forward AlgoNet includes algorithmic layers into existing architectures while a backward AlgoNet can solve inverse problems without or with only weak supervision. In addition, we present the \texttt{algonet} package, a PyTorch based library that includes, inter alia, a smooth evaluated programming language, a smooth 3D mesh renderer, and smooth sorting algorithms.
