We define group-twisted Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber maps for converting between bimodule resolutions of skew group algebras. These algebras are the natural semidirect products recording actions of finite groups by automorphisms. The group-twisted chain maps allow us to transfer information between resolutions for use in homology theories, for example, in those governing deformation theory. We show how to translate in particular from the default (but often cumbersome) reduced bar resolution to a more convenient twisted product resolution. This provides a more universal approach to some known results classifying PBW deformations.
