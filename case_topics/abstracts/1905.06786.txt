We present a frequency domain based $H_\infty$-control strategy to solve boundary control problems for systems governed by parabolic or hyperbolic partial differential equation, where controllers are constrained to be physically implementable and of simple structure suited for practical applications. The efficiency of our technique is demonstrated by controlling a reaction-diffusion equation with input delay, and a wave equation with boundary anti-damping.
