Traditional ghost imaging acquires images via the correlation of the intensity fluctuations of reference patterns and bucket values, and can even generate positive-negative images by conditionally averaging partial patterns. Here, we propose a domino successive-deviation ghost imaging method, which owns a good image quality comparable to that of differential ghost imaging with real-time fast computation, and a better robustness in practical scenarios where measurement noise and the instability of illuminating source coexists. Furthermore, it happens to generate real-time positive and negative images, giving a new insight into physical essence of positive-negative ghost image phenomenon. Both simulation and experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach. Therefore, this work complements the theory of ghost imaging and opens a door to practical applications of real-time single-pixel imaging.
