As more and more applications and services depend on data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it is of utmost importance that such data can be trusted. While data provenance solutions together with blockchain technology are one way to make data more trustworthy, current solutions do not address the heterogeneous nature of IoT applications and their data. In this work, we identify functional and non-functional requirements for a generic IoT data provenance framework, and conceptualise the framework as a layered architecture. Using our proof-of-concept implementation based on Ethereum smart contracts, data provenance concepts can be realised for a wide range of IoT use cases. Benefits of a generic framework include simplified adoption and a more rapid implementation of data provenance for the IoT.
