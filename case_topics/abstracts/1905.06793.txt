In this paper we introduce a new type of restriction problem, called the \textit{restriction problem with moments}. We show that the surface area measure of the sphere satisfies the $L^p$-$L^2$ restriction problem with moments if $1 \leq p < \frac{2(d+2)}{d+3}$ and that the Frostman measure constructed by Salem satisfies the $L^p$-$L^2$ restriction problem with moments if $1 \leq p < \frac{2(2-2α+β)}{4(1-α)+β}$ for certain values of $α$ and $β$.
  The main tool to obtain these new type of restriction phenomenon is the notion of distributions with decay in connection with classes of global $L^q$ ultradifferentiable functions. We develop the notion of distributions with decay and use it to define global wavefront sets of classes of function spaces, including $L^p$-Sobolev spaces on \mathbb{R}^d$ as well as global $L^q$-Denjoy Carleman functions. We also introduce the corresponding notion of microglobal regularity. We prove a characterization of distributions (in a given function space) with decay in terms of microglobal regularity in every direction of their Fourier transforms.
