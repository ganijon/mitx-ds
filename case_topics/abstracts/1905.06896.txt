Consider a graph $G$ and an initial coloring, where each node is blue or red. In each round, all nodes simultaneously update their color based on a predefined rule. In a threshold model, a node becomes blue if a certain number or fraction of its neighbors are blue and red otherwise. What is the minimum number of nodes which must be blue initially so that the whole graph becomes blue eventually? We study this question for graphs which have expansion properties, parameterized by spectral gap, in particular the Erdős-Rényi random graph and random regular graphs.
