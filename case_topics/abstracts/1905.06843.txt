This paper deals with the design and experimental validation of a state-of-the art tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for achieving time-constrained tasks. Given the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robot as well as a high-level task written in Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL), the goal is to design a feedback control law that guarantees the satisfaction of the task. The workspace is divided into Regions of Interest (RoI) and contains also unsafe regions (obstacles) that the robot should not visit. The feedback control law consists of two terms: a control input which is the outcome of a Finite Horizon Optimal Control (FHOCP); and a state feedback law that guarantees that the nominal trajectories are bounded within a tube centered along the nominal trajectories. The aforementioned control law guarantees that the robot is safely navigated through the RoI within certain time bounds. The proposed framework can handle the rich expressiveness of MITL and is experimentally tested with a Nexus mobile robot in our lab facilities. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is promising for solving real-life robotic as well as industrial problems.
