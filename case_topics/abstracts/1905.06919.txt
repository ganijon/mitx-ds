The dissipative solutions are recently studied as a generalized concept for weak solution of complete Euler system. Apparently, they are expectations of suitable measure valued solutions. Here we show that it has to coincide with the Besov solution if the later exists. We consider one measure valued solution, one weak solution with certain Besov regularity and then we show that they coincide if velocity the Besov solution satisfies a lower bound condition on the distributional derivative. Our result also tells that there can exist atmost one Besov solution with the aforementioned condition. The method relies on the commutator estimate [16] and the relative entropy proposed in [10].
